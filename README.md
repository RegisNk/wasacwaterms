# 💧 Smart Water Management System  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Smart Water Management System** is designed to help users **monitor their daily water consumption** and **manage their balance remotely**. The system automatically closes the water valve when:  
- The **user’s balance reaches zero**  
- The **daily consumption limit** is exceeded  

It features a **real-time monitoring platform** built with **HTML, JavaScript, and Firebase**, where users can track their water usage and balance.  

## 🎯 Features  
✅ **Real-time water monitoring** via Firebase  
✅ **Automatic valve control** based on balance  
✅ **LED indicators** (Green = Active, Red = Balance Zero)  
✅ **ESP32 microcontroller** for sensor integration  
✅ **Live dashboard** for users  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **ESP32 Microcontroller** (for IoT functionality)  
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** (Monitoring UI)  
- **Firebase Realtime Database** (Live data updates)  
- **Wokwi & Proteus** (Simulation tools)  
- **GitHub Pages** (Deployment)
